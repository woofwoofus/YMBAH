#day 2

Experimented a lot with animations. Just testing the waters; getting a feeling for how difficult it could be. Some issues came up with animations that adapt to the screen resolution. More difficult than first thought. However, MVP is getting the app to work on my own phone so I'll focus on that.

#day 3

Started work on the structure on the app. Stopped early on in the process because I didn't have a good plan formed in my head yet. Watched a lot of tutorials online. Decided to use fragments for most of the screen layout. Right now limited to 2/3 activities with a lot of fragments in each one. Some concerns about performance but with the limited amount of views per mini-game it shouldn't be a problem.
