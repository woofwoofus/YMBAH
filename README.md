# PROJECT: YMBAH
##Android 'Mini-Game' Game

You Must Build A House (YMBAH) is a game that features a variety of different mini games. The overall objective is to build a house. This is accomplished by several mini-games which simulate different construction steps (Chopping trees, Building a frame, Mining for materials, etc.). These mini-games make use of touch-screen finger tracking where the users have to perform tasks with varying levels of difficulty and precision. 


##Features

* More than X different mini-games that test your skill and precision! (Where X is dependent on remaining production time)
* Progressively more difficult levels that test you speed and managing skills!
* Survival and Zen game modes!
* Stunning Graphics! (maybe...)

##MVP

This app is very modular in design; Parts and features can be added or removed as time allows. However, There are several different features that are required for basic functionality. 

* Home screen
> This should speak for itself. The home screen is where players can choose to start a game or navigate to the options menu. Clicking on 'New Game' will give the option to choose between different game modes.

* Options screen
> The options screen allows users to change different settings of the app. This includes but is not limited to: Language and sound/music volume levels.

* Game screen
> This is the meat of the product. As envisioned, the game screen features a static background with various moving elements. The player will be required to perform an action by use of the touch screen. For example:

![](doc/Dig_Sand.png)

> On this screen the player is tasked to dig some sand. The line the user must trace is made visible due to the discolouration in the sand. By tracing this edge, the sand is dug and will fly towards the top of the screen. The user has now collected 1 sand resource and the counter at the top of the screen will increment by 1. The screen then refreshes, either by fading to white/black and back, or by 'moving' the screen over to the next area (Or just spawning a new sand pile). The user is able to switch to other screens by using the navigation bar at the top of the screen.
